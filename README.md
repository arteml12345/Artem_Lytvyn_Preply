Data Scientist - Technical interview.pdf is an original task that ireceived

Data Scientist Artem Lytvyn.docx is a file with my answers and solutions

scripts.sql is a file with SQL scripts from SQL part of the task. It should be the same as in .docx file

recommender_system is a folder with recommendation engine. Here is what it contains:

  analysis.py is a script with some calculations for the test. It may be used as an example of recommendation engine usage.
  
  run_tests.py is a script that runs test for the engine
  
  testing/tests.py contains all the tests made for the engine
  
  input_data/Preply_tutor_views_datasaet.csv is a data that engine is based on
  
  functions/matrix_factorization.py contains functionality for matrix factorisation (see Data Scientist Artem Lytvyn.docx for details)
  
  functions/data_functions.py holds functions for data reading and preprocessing
  
  functions/recommendations.py holds functionality for making ratings and forming recommendations
  
  functions/recommendation_engine.py holds class that wraps around all the functionality of the engine in a singe object with train-predoct manner. But all the fuctionality form functions/ can be used as stand alone

As a general note code base is covered by tests, so if something is unclear one may look for corresponding test function for usage example.

### If something is unclear or you expected something diffrent or have some technical problem, please let me know, I will fix it as fast as possible.
